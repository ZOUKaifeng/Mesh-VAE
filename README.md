### 1. Requirements
This code is tested on Python3.8, Pytorch versoin 1.11.0+cu113, torch-geometric version 2.0.4 . Requirments can be install by running

      pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Install mesh processing libraries from [MPI-IS/mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh). Note that the python3 version of mesh package library is needed for this.

### 2. Download the datasets
Since we test on a private dataset, the original dataset is not available.
However we provide a fake dataset generated by our Mesh VAE to validate the algorithm.
You can download it from [**google drive**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lVOGER1l5ezHXPi1VRDAJme7esnLsEc/view?usp=share_link)

### 3. Training
```bash
python main_CHUSE.py
```
